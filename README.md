Conversational Robots
=====================

Artificial intelligence systems programmed to communicate with one another.

Designed and Programmed by Osaze Shears.

Project Goal
------------
The goal of this project is to create artificial intelligence classes with the ability recognize speech from eachother and respond to that speech accordingly. 
The classes use database files which contain a set of standard responses to the questions they will be asked. 
The classes choose responses randomly.


Current Features
----------------
* Ability to Modify the Responses in the General and Personal Databases
* Ability to Customize Responses based on Specific Personal Definitions
* Ability to Change the Colors of the Responses of the Classes
  

Controls
--------
Simply execute the program by navigating to the `\"Conversational Robots"\` directory and typing `python3 convorobsMain.py`


Planned Additions
-----------------
* Ability for conversations to occur with multiple agents
* Increased amount of responses
* GUI to display faces of the classes


Optional Requirements
------------
* POSIX Python Module
  * This is if the user wants to hear the robots respond to each other 


Change Log
----------
* Version 1.0 - Randomized Conversations by Referencing Responses in Response Databases
